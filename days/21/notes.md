My solution for this day is admittedly very janky, but later AoC days tend to do that for me.

Part 1 was an absolute pleasure and allowed me to have fun with some otherwise little-explored parts of C++.

For part 2, however, I took a bunch of liberties and manually checked some example numbers to gain some insight into how the system behaves. I had initially planned to think about inverting the computation (sort of a backpropagation approach one might say, how very up to date), but then it turned out that a simple binary search is absolutely fast enough.
