Ah, the devil of premature optimization. I started looking for an efficient solution and immediately (and predictably) ran into a minor obstacle. Luckily I remembered the old AoC lesson: write dumb code first, you can always optimize later. Turns out that part 2 did not, in fact, force me to optimize due to complexity escalation. Now I *like* that it was simple, but it also feels like (again) a missed opportunity for a more interesting task.
