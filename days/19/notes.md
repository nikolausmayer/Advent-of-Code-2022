Good grief, this year is a *gauntlet*. My solution for part 1 already took some ugly shortcuts (which might not work for all possible blueprints), but part 2 with 33% more time was brutal. My solution contains what I would consider a good candidate for the world's least informative heuristic -- *but it works*!!
