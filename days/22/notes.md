Wow.

First of all, I *love* map puzzles and these tasks involving physical motion. I also *love* everything 3D, so the particular map layout in part 1 immediately tipped me off to a cube map, but not so. Part 1 was a delight, and nicely solveable for general maps.

Part 2, however... phew. This took *a lot* of manual engineering (I even built a paper cube map model to make sure I got the edge transitions right!), and unfortunately my solution would not work for another map. I am still not quite sure whether it would have been faster or slower to write a general solution, as parsing the input into 3D sounds like a nightmare.

Anyway, a wonderful day. I am somewhat surprised (in hindsight, to be fair) that the solve ratio for part 2 is extremely low -- it is not a theoretically hard task, "only" a ton of work.
