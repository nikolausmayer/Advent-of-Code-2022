This day was my brick wall.

I initially had *absolutely no clue* how to progress even on part 1.
It felt like one of those "hard" LeetCode problems that just leave me staring into the void until I look up other people's solutions.

Luckily, I remembered a similar task from an AoC way back and realized that performing a search over self-and-elephant states was likely to blow up in complexity.
Instead, after much fumbling around I found a somewhat useable solution.

This is a great task, still!
