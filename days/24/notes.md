This day went way smoother than it had any right to do. This might be one of my favourite A\* tasks of any AoC.

There really isn't much to say here. Translating the input into a lookup function for tile traversability was as much fun as giddily triplicating the same search code for all three legs of the trip.

And I didn't even run into signedness or overflow bugs this time! **Progress!**
